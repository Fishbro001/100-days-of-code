# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 2nd, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on Codecademy on Javascript, and finish a course on freecodecamp on basic html.

**Thoughts** Although I know a bit of programming and the things they are teaching me are pretty basic, I know I have to start with them, even though they are
pretty boring, cause I tried building a website on my own and it was filled with spaghetti code.

### Day 2: April 3nd, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've finished a course on basic CSS on freecodecamp.

**Thoughts** Not that much interesting, but I learned a few things on how to style the website, most importantly I think I learned was the differences between
ids and classes and attributes, how to use each of them to style. And learned how to declare variables in css

### Day 3: April 4nd, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've almost finished a course on "Applied Visual Design" (12 challenges short) about CSS on freecodecamp.

**Thoughts** I got sick today, so I spent most of the day sleeping. Was hard to put myself to it, was a good excuse, but decided not to do it.

### Day 4: April 5nd, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've finished a course on "Applied Visual Design" about CSS on freecodecamp.

**Thoughts**: Can't spend more time today, and tomorrow I am going to countryside, where I won't be able to update, because I don't have internet there.
But I will update for two days whenever I am able.

### Day 5-6: April 5nd-6th, Saturday-Sunday

**Progress**: Worked on a prototype website, one day, and the other day tried to get ::before or ::after working on css and couldn't.

**Thoughts**: Frustrated 

### Day 7: April 7th, Monday

**Progress**: Worked on a prototype website. Was having difficulty not realising I needed to add display:inline-block property

**Thoughts**: I feel like I made good amount of progress and managed to digest all the learning material.

### Day 8: April 9nd, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Almost finished a course on Basics of Javascript

**Thoughts**: 80% done. Pretty fun, but I knew most of that stuff so that's why it went smoothly.

### Day 9: April 10nd, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Learned a bit about Node.js, tried running a server on my computer, looks like it works, but couldn't make it visible 
outside my pc.

**Thoughts**: I am glad I started this challenge, I think if I didn't, I would have quit long time ago.
