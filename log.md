# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 2nd, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on Codecademy on Javascript, and finish a course on freecodecamp on basic html.

**Thoughts** Although I know a bit of programming and the things they are teaching me are pretty basic, I know I have to start with them, even though they are
pretty boring, cause I tried building a website on my own and it was filled with spaghetti code.
