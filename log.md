# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 2nd, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on Codecademy on Javascript, and finish a course on freecodecamp on basic html.

**Thoughts** Although I know a bit of programming and the things they are teaching me are pretty basic, I know I have to start with them, even though they are
pretty boring, cause I tried building a website on my own and it was filled with spaghetti code.

### Day 2: April 3rd, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've finished a course on basic CSS on freecodecamp.

**Thoughts** Not that much interesting, but I learned a few things on how to style the website, most importantly I think I learned was the differences between
ids and classes and attributes, how to use each of them to style. And learned how to declare variables in css

### Day 3: April 4th Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've almost finished a course on "Applied Visual Design" (12 challenges short) about CSS on freecodecamp.

**Thoughts** I got sick today, so I spent most of the day sleeping. Was hard to put myself to it, was a good excuse, but decided not to do it.

### Day 4: April 5th, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've finished a course on "Applied Visual Design" about CSS on freecodecamp.

**Thoughts**: Can't spend more time today, and tomorrow I am going to countryside, where I won't be able to update, because I don't have internet there.
But I will update for two days whenever I am able.
